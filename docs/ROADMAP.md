# VØID Roadmap

## Vision
Become the default privacy execution layer for Solana: a trusted, open-source
privacy primitive that apps can plug into to execute confidential intents with
guaranteed on-chain enforcement.

## Roadmap (business‑oriented)
### Phase 1 — Hackathon launch
- [x] Working end‑to‑end flow (deposit → intent → TEE approval → execute)
- [x] Inco‑based confidential enforcement on chain
- [x] Live Raydium swap demo + output transfer
- [x] Partner RPC selection in extension + server
- [x] Public demo video + quickstart doc
- [x] Open‑source license selection + repo cleanup

### Phase 2 — Builder adoption
- [ ] SDK + reference integration guide (dApp plug‑in)
- [ ] Docs for privacy guarantees + threat model
- [ ] Test suite for integration partners
- [ ] Community feedback loop (issues + roadmap)
- [ ] Chrome Web Store release (store assets + review compliance)

### Phase 3 — Pilot partnerships
- [ ] 1–2 partner dApps on devnet
- [ ] Formalize SLAs for RPC + TEE availability
- [ ] Telemetry + performance dashboards
- [ ] Security review / external audit plan
- [ ] Cross‑browser packaging plan (Safari, Firefox)

### Phase 4 — Scale to mainnet
- [ ] Mainnet pilot with rate limits + allowlist
- [ ] Multi‑RPC routing + failover
- [ ] PER delegation support for high‑throughput paths
- [ ] Production runbook + incident response
- [ ] Safari extension release (App Store)
- [ ] Firefox add‑on release

### Phase 5 — Ecosystem growth
- [ ] Multi‑asset privacy vaults
- [ ] Multi‑chain expansion (if demand)
- [ ] Grants + ecosystem partnerships
- [ ] Open developer marketplace for privacy apps

## Success metrics
- # of dApps integrated
- # of confidential intents executed
- # of extension downloads
- RPC reliability and latency
- Developer adoption of SDK
