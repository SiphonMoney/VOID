# Quicknode at the Solana Privacy Hack

This project uses Quicknode RPCs and keeps all privacy tooling open source.

## Requirements checklist
- **Open source license** (project code is open and reusable)
- **Privacy infrastructure/tooling** (Inco + blind executor flow)
- **Meaningful Quicknode RPC usage** (RPC selection + server execution)
- **Broad utility** for Solana developers/users

## How we use Quicknode RPCs
Quicknode RPCs are used for:
- **Executor program calls** (deposit, withdraw, execute_with_intent)
- **Swap execution + confirmations**
- **Intent processing and on-chain verification**

RPC selection is user-configurable in the extension settings and is passed to
the server for all Solana operations.
